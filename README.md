Preliminary research of the rainfall phenomenon in India shows that it is dependent on various climatic control factors, and every part of the country has a rainfall pattern unique to the region. The study is broadly decided into two parts - decomposition of the rainfall data into the various components of the time seris, and fitting of time series models on the data. We consider for our study the states of Kerala and Punjab. Due to the interdependency of the climatic factors, we have assumed a multiplicative model for our study. The state of Kerala shows a linear decreasing trend, with seasonal indices indicating that the rainfall occurs in the state mainly in 2 periods- maximum during June-September, and during October-November. The state of Punjab shows a quadratic trend which has been decreasing in the recent years. The seasonal indices, confirm a concentrated rainfall period from June to September, with a dry spell in winter months specific to the country. Our results verify the pre-existing research work present on the topic.

For the second part of our study, we fitted SARIMA models for the years 1901-2000, using the Box-Jenkins approach. The fitted models were judged on the basis of the predicted values for the years 2001-2017. Forecasts were obtained up to the year 2023.
